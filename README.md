# Undergraduate Thesis for BSc. (Eng.) Mechatronics

Contains code for my undergraduate thesis.

The folder labelled Penguin contains MATLAB code relevent for importing the penguin data, pre-processing it and implementing the extended kalman filter as well as various other plots and text files for standard deviation, exported data from the KF etc.

The folder labelled Pendulum contains code for the simulation of the motion and implementation of the KF and EKF for the linear and nonlinear pendulum tracking problem.
